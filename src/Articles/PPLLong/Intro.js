        If you’re looking for a way to push through a stubborn plateau or you
        have ever wanted to fit more workouts into your week, then this routine
        is for you. With this intensive plan you’ll be training six days a week
        with the sessions split into three rough categories: push movements,
        pull movements, and leg exercises.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
        It is possible to do so many sessions because of the push pull legs
        structure which allows adequate time for resting each muscle group
        before you train it again.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
        The large volume per week, per muscle group can be a great catalyst for
        progress, but it should be said this is a big workload so make sure that
        you rest your body outside of your sessions, get enough sleep, and be
        aware of the signs of overtraining.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
        When done carefully I think that this routine is one of the most
        effective, efficient methods of training, especially if you are an
        experienced lifter.
