        If you’ve ever felt like you didn't know how to workout your legs at
        home then let me tell you, you are not alone. At a gym there can be an
        entire room full of expensive equipment tailored to hit your quads, your
        glutes, your hamstrings, every muscle you could think of!
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        So you may be thinking how am I supposed to replicate all that at home?
        Well you’re in luck. This workout is designed just for people like you
        who want to get stronger legs without spending the big bucks.

        To do this we will focus on compound movements that efficiently work
        multiple muscles in your legs at once like squats and lunges. These
        movements can be difficult and tiring but don’t be afraid – know your
        limits, be kind to yourself and have fun!
