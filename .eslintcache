Shoulders are not to be neglected\r\n            by anyone serious about fitness, as they are used whenever you pick\r\n            something up, and as such are a secondary muscle group in\r\n            practically every upper body exercise.

Push the weight up until your arms are\r\n            nearly straight, and then let the weight back down making sure it is\r\n            always under control.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </ExerciseItem>\r\n        <ExerciseItem\r\n          title=\"Dumbbell Rows 4x10\"\r\n          imgSrc={[dumbbell_row]}\r\n          ourTip=\"Keep your core tight to avoid strain on your lower back.\r\n        Avoid rounding your back.\"\r\n        >\r\n          <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The back is probably the hardest muscle group to train at home. Pull\r\n            ups are the ideal movement, however, on the assumption that not\r\n            everybody has a pull-up bar in their house, we would recommend\r\n            dumbbell rows.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n          <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Lean with one side left or right of the bench and pull the weight\r\n            towards where your stomach joins your hip. If you have a proper\r\n            gym-style bench, this can be done lying with both arms at once,\r\n            lying face down on the bench to work both sides of your back at the\r\n            same time.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n          <Typography paragraph>\r\n            This exercise can be done with heavier weight, but make sure that\r\n            it’s not out of control and jerky. A big benefit of rows is that\r\n            they will also work the commonly neglected muscles at the back of\r\n            your shoulder as a secondary muscle group.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </ExerciseItem>\r\n        <ExerciseItem\r\n          title=\"Dumbbell Goblet Squats 4x10\"\r\n          imgSrc={[goblet_squat]}\r\n          ourTip=\"While doing this exercise make sure that your weight doesn't shift\r\n          on to your toes.

Squat down as low as you comfortably can\r\n            without your back rounding, and then pushing throught your heels,\r\n            stand back up.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </ExerciseItem>\r\n        <ExerciseItem\r\n          title=\"Triceps Overhead Press 4x10\"\r\n          imgSrc={[overhead_press]}\r\n          ourTip=\"If you are working one arm at a time, use your free arm to\r\n        hold your working-arm’s elbow in place.

This is why we do workouts from home.\r\n            Seriously though, it is a very tough movement to do repeatedly as it\r\n            really puts pressure on your hamstrings and quads. If you don’t want\r\n            to brag about doing Dumbbell Weighted Lunges, that’s on you, but the\r\n            exercise is legit and will fatigue your muscles to a great extent.\r\n          </Typography>\r\n          <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Alternating legs and going until failure is an option for the\r\n            sado-masichists amongst us but for normal people 4x10 will do, maybe\r\n            even 3x10 if it’s your first time. Don’t dip too much lower than 90\r\n            degrees unless you have the flexibility to do so.

We will repeat each\r\n        category twice a week. In my opinion, Push-Pull-Legs is the most\r\n        efficient method of training to see the most results. Especially if you\r\n        are a keen lifter. This is only because PPL provides a good amount of\r\n        rest coupled with a large amount of volume per week, per muscle group.\r\n        Even though you are training six times a week, each muscle group is\r\n        being worked a maximum of twice, with at least 48 hours rest between\r\n        working days.

For example, if your legs are\r\n        lagging behind the rest of your body, train legs twice a week instead of\r\n        one of the other muscle groups. Because body parts are trained so\r\n        frequently, even in busy weeks you will still manage to target each\r\n        muscle group at least once.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography paragraph variant=\"body1\">\r\n        Once again I reiterate that this is probably the most volume you can\r\n        squeeze into this time period without your body suffering negative\r\n        consequences.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography paragraph variant=\"body1\">\r\n        As always it is important to make sure that your fitness expectations\r\n        are challenging but sensible.
